"Das Haus das Verr√ºckte macht."

**Noze.io** is an attempt to carry over the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
ideas into *pure* [Swift](http://swift.org).
It uses [libdispatch](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch)
for event-driven, non-blocking I/O.
**Noze.io** is built around type-safe back-pressure aware pull-streams
(using Swift generics)
operating on batches of items. Instead of just operating on bytes,
operate on batches of Unicode lines or database records or HTML
responses or - you get the idea.
Be efficient: Stream everything and √üatch.

A focus is to keep the API similar to Node. Not always possible -
Swift is not JavaScript - but pretty close.
It comes with rechargeables included, **Noze.io** is self-contained and
doesn't require any extra dependencies.

**Noze.io** works in Cocoa environments as well as on Linux,
and it works with Swift 2.2 as well as the latest Swift 3 drop.
In fact we suggest 2.2 until 
[Swift 3](https://swift.org/blog/swift-3-0-release-process/)
is actually released.
Head over to our [Start](http://noze.io/start/) page for install instructions.

*Is it a good idea?* You [tell us](http://noze.io/about/).
Not sure, but we think it might be, because:
*a)* While Swift looks *very* much like JavaScript, it is actually a very
high performance statically typed and AOT-compiled language,
*b)* Code often looks better in Swift, mostly due to trailing-closure syntax,
*c)* No monkey patching while still providing extensions.
~~There are cons too.~~

#### Shows us some code!

There is a reasonably large collection of simple, focused:
[Noze.io examples](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/tree/master/Samples)
But here you go, the "standard" Node example, a HelloWorld httpd:

    import http

    http.createServer { req, res in 
      res.writeHead(200, [ "Content-Type": "text/html" ])
      res.end("\<h1\>Hello World\</h1\>")
    }
    .listen(1337)

An echo daemon, just piping the in-end of a socket into its own-out end:

    import net

    net.createServer { sock in
      sock.write("Welcome to Noze.io!\r\n")
      sock | sock
    }
    .listen(1337)

More complex stuff including a Todo-MVC backend can be found in the
[Noze.io examples](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/tree/master/Samples).

Noze.io supports Swift 2.2.1 in addition to the latest Swift 3 'preview'.
Swift 2.2.1 is still the only stable Swift version.
Supporting both makes some code in Noze ugly, but it is still required to make 
the usage of Noze.io smooth. Always found it a pain to use Swift 3 projects ...
(as you carefully need to select specific Swift 3 dumps as well as GCD).

### Status

- We chose the traditional Swift approach:
  Make something barely usable, though demoable,
  and release it with a 2.0 version tag.
  Then hope that the community kicks in and fills open spots.
  Well kinda. It's pretty good already! üòâ

- It already has
  [leftpad](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/tree/develop/Sources/leftpad).
  As well as [cows üêÆ](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/blob/master/Sources/cows/README.md)!

- Implements primarily the happy path. Errors will error. Presumably this
  will improve over time.

- A huge strength of Node is the npm package environment and the
  <a href="http://heathersfilm.tripod.com/script.txt" target="ext">myriad</a>s 
  of packages available for it.
  Or wait, is it? Well, at least we have
  [leftpad](https://github.com/NozeIO/Noze.io/tree/develop/Sources/leftpad)
  included.
  And we hope that the [Swift package](https://swift.org/package-manager/)
  environment is going to grow as well.

- There are tons of open ends in Noze.io. We welcome contributions of all kinds.
