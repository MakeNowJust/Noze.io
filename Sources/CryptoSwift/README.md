# CryptoSwift

This is a tiny snapshot (based on 13764570021ca73c315c3de18f367e5fdb55d785) of 
the excellent
[CryptoSwift](https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/CryptoSwift)
framework by [Marcin Krzy≈ºanowski](mailto:marcin@krzyzanowskim.com).

At the time the Noze.io copy only includes the stuff required for `MD5` hashing.

Presumably we eventually would like to import all of CryptoSwift (or replace it
with OpenSSL?)
Well, and eventually, once Swift Package Manager is something which works cool
in Xcode, just refer to the upstream repository ...
