# Noze.io Express

Express is a Noze.io module modelled after the
[ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com)
framework.
As usual in Noze.io the module is supposed to be as similar as possible.

Express is a module based on top of 
[Connect](../connect).
It is also based on middleware, but adds 
additional routing features,
support for templates,
and more fancy conveniences ;-)

## Examples

Noze.io comes with some Express examples:

- [express-simple](../../Samples/express-simple)
  (Mustache templates, forms, some JSON, cookies, session)
- [todo-mvc](../../Samples/todo-mvc)
  (A simple in-memory Todolist application backend aka TodoMVC)
- [todo-mvc-redis](../../Samples/todo-mvc-redis)
  (A simple Todolist application backend aka TodoMVC which stores the data into
   Redis)
