/// ArrayBuffer<T> - an array of arrays managing elements of type T
///
/// This is because we often get arrays of bytes in APIs (aka buckets), and it
/// seems more efficient to keeps those buckets as-is, instead of merging them
/// into a BIG, serialized array.
///
/// Note: The dequeing returns a Bucket, not a Bridgade. Hence it might need to
/// merge. TBD: is this good? or should we dequeue Brigades?
///
/// Also: I think in Apache buckets can be of different types. Eg a
/// Bucket<UInt8> could be either an in-memory array of bytes, or a file
/// descriptor! Passing around the file descriptor would be way more efficient
/// (i.e. if the sole bucket is a file, one could sendfile() a file straight to
/// a socket instead of copying the bytes).
///
/// TBD: Bad name? Better name it BrigadeArray or something? Or at least
///      NozeArrayBuffer - ArrayBuffer sounds like it is a Foundation class.
///
/// TBD: In this implementation a Bucket is fixed to be an array of UInt8, it
///      actually can't be a different type of Bucket (like a File<UInt8>).
